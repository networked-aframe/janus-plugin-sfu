# Deployment with a docker image

This Dockerfile is based on the instructions of the
[Janus deployment on Ubuntu 20.04](https://github.com/networked-aframe/naf-janus-adapter/blob/master/docs/janus-deployment.md)
documentation in naf-janus-adapter repository. The janus-gateway version and
janus-plugin-sfu version used may slightly diverge though.

You can follow the steps in the above documentation to install a server, then
instead of following the "Build it", "Configure it" and "Start janus as a
service", use the docker image described below.

If you previously installed janus on the host with systemd, stop it and disable it:

```
systemctl stop janus
systemctl disable janus
```

Be aware that ports 7088 (admin http with default janusoverlord password) and 8188 (ws) are exposed to the host network interface.
So be sure to change the password and configure your instance security group properly to not have access to
those ports externally and configure nginx in front that handle the TLS termination.

Those environment variables with default values are available:

```
ADMIN_SECRET=janusoverlord
DEBUG_LEVEL=4
SESSION_TIMEOUT=38
MAX_ROOM_SIZE=30
MAX_CCU=1000
MESSAGE_THREADS=0
```

In order to take advantage of event loops / loop indication, the respective environment variables are available:

``` 
EVENT_LOOPS="true"
ALLOW_LOOP_INDICATION="true"
```

The default values are defined at the beginning of the `start.sh` script.

## Installing docker

see https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/

## Using docker

create the docker image:

```
cd docker
docker build --pull -t janus:latest .
```

If you previously built the image and want to rebuild with latest janus-plugin-sfu,
in the Dockerfile on the RUN janus-plugin-sfu line be sure to increment the version
in the echo command so the layer cache of the RUN command is invalidated. This
is a trick so the rebuild is quicker if the base image didn't change.
Or simply add `--no-cache` option when building the image but it takes more time to
rebuild like it was the first time:

```
docker build --pull --no-cache -t janus:latest .
```

start the container:

```
docker run -d --restart always --net=host --name="janus" -e MAX_ROOM_SIZE=15 -e ADMIN_SECRET=YourOwnPassword janus:latest
```

If you secure the rooms with JWT, specify the public key like this:

```
docker run -d --restart always --net=host --name="janus" -e MAX_ROOM_SIZE=15 -e ADMIN_SECRET=YourOwnPassword -e AUTH_KEY=/keys/public.der -v $PWD/public.der:/keys/public.der:ro janus:latest
```

look at the logs:

```
docker logs -f janus
```

stop and remove the container:

```
docker stop janus
docker rm janus
```

## Using docker compose

create the docker image:

```
docker compose build --pull
```

or

```
docker compose build --pull --no-cache
```

to rebuild with latest janus-plugin-sfu changes.

configure environment variables in `.env`, example:

```
ADMIN_SECRET=YourOwnPassword
MAX_ROOM_SIZE=15
```

start the container:

```
docker compose up -d
```

If you secure the rooms with JWT, uncomment the AUTH_KEY variable and volume in `docker-compose.yml`.

look at the logs:

```
docker compose logs -f
```

stop and remove the container:

```
docker compose down
```
